#Something about

Pressing a key on your keyboard fires the event in most browsers with a short delay. FastKey is the approach for exactly this inconvenience.

It is based upon jQuery and written to be small and nevertheless useful.


#How to use

It is quite simple!

**1st** Include jQuery and the plugin:

    <script src='jQuery.js'></script>
    <script src='jQuery.fastKey.js'></script>

**2nd** Initialize the plugin with your key and function:

    $.fastKey('your key', function() {
        // your function
    });

**3rd** Fire your key-event fast!
